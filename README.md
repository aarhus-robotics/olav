# Overview

This repository holds the source code for the interfaces to OLAV, the
**O**ff-road **L**ight **A**utonomous **V**ehicle. OLAV has been running
autonomously since 2014 as an off-road autonomous driving development platform
at the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment (FFI).

FFI open-sourced the OLAV codebase in 2023 after Aarhus University acquired the
vehicle. The original interfaces the underwent a major rewrite including the
migration from ROS to ROS 2.
