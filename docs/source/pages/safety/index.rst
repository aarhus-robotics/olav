Safety
======

OLAV is a vehicle intended for research on autonomous offroad operation.  Because of its nature, it underwent limited
safety testing and is to be treated with the utmost respect by the user.

Below is a list of safety precautions and checks to be followed and performed when operating OLAV.

General safety precautions
--------------------------

Common sense rules
__________________

1. Wear the provided protective headwear at all times during vehicle operation.

2. Never operate the vehicle in fully autonomous mode alone from the passenger seat or without immediate access to the
   physical vehicle controls (i.e. no equipment allowed between the user and the steering wheel).

3. When using HMI features (through the computers in the system or through personal laptop computers) always have a
   designated driver sitting by your side.

Operating on-road
_________________

1. When operating within the building premises, ensure no areas of the building are accessible to the public. Use a tall
   flag to signal closure and striped construction tape to close off entrances.

2. If outside of the storage building premises, ensure the speed selector switch, accessible underneath the passenger
   seat, is the to the **Turtle** icon. **Rabbit** operation is only allowed within building premises.


Checklists
----------

Before starting the vehicle
___________________________

1. Check that all battery-operated equipment has a sufficient state of charge. 

Safety procedures
_________________

Before letting your foot off the brake:

1. Check your gear selection on the vehicle dashboard digital indicator. Do NOT rely on the physical gear selector knob
   for deducing the currently selected gear, as the drive by wire system may override the selection knob internally.

2. Ensure no cables are connected to ground-fixed equipment (power outlets, wall-mounted ethernet sockets, lab
   equipment, personal laptops, etc.) and that no cables are dangling close to moving parts of the vehicle.

IT security
-----------

Do **NOT** store sensitive information on the OLAV systems. All system partitions are unencrypted and system users are
protected by simple passwords. When deploying your system to OLAV, rely on ad-hoc deploy keys above password authentications.
