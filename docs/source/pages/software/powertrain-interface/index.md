# Powertrain interface

The powertrain interface node publishes engine and wheel speed information
through an Arduino Micro microcontroller. It provides engine speed and wheel
speeds, as well as an emergency flag to monitor the state of the
microcontroller.

Refer to the powertrain microcontroller sensor page `Powertrain microcontroller
sensor`_. for more information on the sensing equipment.
